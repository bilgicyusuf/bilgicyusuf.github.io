UPSTAT Conference is a regional conference of American Statistical Association (ASA) in Statistics and Data Science. Our students attend and present their capstone projects in Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning and Stochastic Modeling. In 2018, it was held at University of Rochester on April 20-21. Our Geneseo math students contributed to the talks with 6 teams. Three Geneseo teams won awards (two bronzes and one honorable) on the Computation and Applications category, in which a total of 20 teams from other regional colleges and universities were evaluated and the total of six teams was awarded only.
