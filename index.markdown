### Who I am
I am a statistician, data scientist, and educator.

### Fields of Research Interest
In brief, my research interests include applied, computational and theoretical statistics, interdisciplinary work with any disciplines, data science, machine learning algorithms and statistics education. I extend robust nonparametric procedures in estimation, prediction and testing for linear and non-linear models theoretically and computationally to various hierarchical/random-eﬀects mod-els. In particular, it includes nonparametric and robust modeling and estimate, prediction and testing in models with dependent error structures, i.e. rank-based statistical modeling of hierarchical/nested designs such as random-eﬀects models. Teaching Probability and Statistics and Data Science for K-18 is my synergic motivation. Currently, I apply and robustify hot machine learning algorithms to various contexts jointly with my students.
